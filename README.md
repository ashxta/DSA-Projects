# C Programming Projects (DSA)

This repository contains various C programming projects focusing on different algorithms, data structures, and practical applications. Each project demonstrates key concepts such as graphs, trees, self-referential structures, and algorithm complexities.

## Projects

1. **Algorithm Complexity - Time Complexity**
   - A program that compares the time complexity of different algorithms and visualizes the performance.

2. **Cash Flow Minimizer - Graphs and Heaps**
   - A tool for minimizing cash flow among a group of people, leveraging graphs and heaps.

3. **Contact Management - Self Referential Structure**
   - A contact management system using a self-referential structure (Linked List), which allows for efficient management of contacts.

4. **File System Simulation - Trees**
   - A file system simulation that utilizes tree data structures to represent directories and files, demonstrating the organization and management of files.

5. **Map Navigator - Dijkstra's Algorithm**
   - A map navigation system that uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between locations, simulating GPS functionality.

6. **Snake Game - Arrays**
   - A classic Snake game implemented using arrays in C. The game logic includes movement, food spawning, and game-over conditions.
